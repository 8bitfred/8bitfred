The Game
--------
The more tombs (mazes) Fred explores, the tougher the going. The number of
monsters increases and they get meaner and faster.

Monsters
--------

**Rats**: These run through the labyrinth, the only way to avoid them is to jump
at the right moment.

**Acid Drops**: From the decomposing mixtures of the Egyptian Magicians.
Careful timing is needed to get past them.

**Ghosts**: Beware, they can go through walls. They change direction when shot.

**Chameleons**: They can be passed by climbing the rope on the opposite side, but
they can change sides too!!

**Mummies**: They fall through the vertical corridors. They can teleport when
they stop falling or are hit by a bullet.

**Vampires**: They chase through the maze and can stop flying or even develop a
high speed. They can be stopped by being shot.

**Skeletons**: They chase relentlessly, and can only be stopped by being shot.


**Power**: Fred's strength is maximum at 15 and reduces by one each time a
monster hits. Two extra units are gained each time the magic elixir of
Nefertiti is drunk and when he reaches the exit.

**Weapons**: Fred has a gun and six bullets which he can replenish en route. He
cannot shoot whilst climbing a rope.

**Treasures**: Varying in value, they may be picked up by just walking over them,
with bonus points on exit.

**Map**: A map is displayed when Fred discovers one in the maze. Fred is in the
centre.

**Screens**: There are six screens, increasing in difficulty, followed by the
option to return to screen 1 or redefine the maze. The number of monsters
has to be defined with two figures, e.g. 09, etc.
